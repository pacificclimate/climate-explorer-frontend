    A [GCM (General Circulation Model)](http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/gcm_guide.html') is
    a numerical model representing
    physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and land surface
    of the Earth.
    GCMs are the most advanced tools currently available for simulating the
    response of the global climate system to increasing greenhouse gas
    concentrations.
  monthlyAnnualVarNameAmbiguityCaution:
    Unlike most Climdex variable names used in PCEX,
    this variable name can refer to either an annual version
    (calculation spanning a calendar year) or to the standard
    Climdex monthly version. The distinction is shown in the
    English description part of labels in selectors, so that the
    meaning in each specific context is unambiguous.

    title: '# Frequently Asked Questions'
    intro: |
      The content of our FAQ is driven by our users' needs and questions.

      At present, we have relatively few questions and answers here,
      because we don't yet know what you, our user, needs to know.
      Please [email us](mailto:${$$.components.contacts.csg.email})
      with questions you would like to see in the FAQ.

    items:
      - question: Which model should I select?
        answer: |
          The PCIC12 model is an ensemble average of twelve models selected to
          provide the widest spread in projected future climate for Canada. It is
          a good default choice if you do not have specialized needs that would
          be better represented by a different model.

      - question: What emissions scenario should I select?
        answer: |
          The worst-case emissions scenario, RCP 8.5
          (presented in the selectors as `historical, rcp85`),
          is a good choice for making decisions that adapt to climate change.

      - question: How can I upload a polygon successfully?
        answer: |
          Climate Explorer's polygon upload feature currently has some known
          problems. These are slated to be fixed, but in the meantime, here
          is a guide to successfully uploading a polygon

          ## Summary

          Below is a summary of recommendations and workarounds.

          1. **File format**: It is probably best to upload
          [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) files
          (file extension `.geojson` or `.json`). Why?

             1. There may be additional problems with Shapefiles.

             1. GeoJSON files are human readable and easy to manipulate using
            a text editor into the form you need (e.g., Multipolygon, etc.;
            see below).

          1. **CRS**: Express coordinates in [EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)
          (a.k.a. WGS:84; standard long-lat coordinates).

          1. **Polygon length**: Limit your polygons to a maximum of 100 vertices.
          This will not affect the accuracy of the results you get from
          Climate Explorer. If you have much more detailed polygons, there
          are GIS tools that can decimate them for you.

          1. **GeoJSON content type**: If it is important to average over more than one polygon,
          encode that collection as a Multipolygon.
          Otherwise place your polygons into separate files, and upload
          each file as needed.

          ## File format

          We have reports from users that they also have problems with
          Shapefiles. We have not yet investigated these reports,
          so our current recommandation is to use
          [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON).

          GeoJSON is a text file format, employing the widely used
          [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) standard, that is easy to
          understand and modify.
          If your GeoJSON file (of whatever provenance)
          needs to be changed to be compatible with Climate Explorer,
          it should be fairly easy to change using any text editor.

          There are online tools for converting shapefiles (and other formats)
          to GeoJSON. A search with the phrase "convert shapefile to geojson"
          will turn up several candidates.

          ## CRS (Coordinate Reference System)

          Coordinates in any file uploaded to Climate Explorer must be in
          standard long-lat coordinates ([EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)).

          It is simplest if you can generate your files directly in EPSG:4325
          coordinates.

          However, if your files are in a different coordinate system,
          there are tools for converting them.
          One such tool, useful if you are a user of Node.js, is
          [reproject](https://github.com/perliedman/reproject).

          ## Polygon length

          Climate Explorer cannot handle polygons with more than about
          400 vertices (coordinates).

          (In principle there is no problem with complicated polygons, but
          currently there is a limitation on the length of data we can send
          from the client application (in the browser) to the Climate Explorer
          backend.)

          If you have large polygons (many vertices), we suggest that you
          define simpler (less detailed) boundaries for these polygons,
          using 100 or fewer coordinates per polygon.
          This is very unlikely to make any significant difference to the
          results you get from Climate Explorer. Our datasets are relatively
          coarse spatially, and so the set of grid cells over which spatial
          averaging is done is likely to be either identical or very similar --
          so similar that there would be no significant difference.

          ## GeoJSON content type

          CE does handle both FeatureCollections and Multipolygons. However ...

          * ​With FeatureCollections, only one (the textually first in the file)
          of the polygons can be active at one time.
          The others are displayed, but inactive, which is to say that they
          do not participate in the spatial averaging.
          There is no way at present to have all polygons in a
          FeatureCollection contribute to the spatial averaging.
          This is not desirable behaviour but it is currently the case.

          * For technical reasons, all the polygons in a Multipolygon DO
          contribute to the spatial averaging.
          This may prompt you to revise how your GeoJSON files are structured.
          With a text editor, it is a relatively simple process to convert a
          FeatureCollection to a Multipolygon. Please refer to GeoJSON
          documentation for more information on these two formats.

      - question: How do I zoom in on the map?
        answer: |
          Click the **+** button to zoom in.

          Click the **-** button to zoom out.

          Alternatively, use the scroll wheel on your mouse, or, with a touch
          screen, pinch to zoom in and spread to zoom out.

      - question: |
          What are the small triangles in the column labels of tables
          like the Statistical Summary for?
        answer: |
          They are used to sort the table by that column.

          Click on a column header to sort by that column.

        ## Overview

        ### What it is

        PCIC Climate Explorer (PCEX) is an interactive web application that
        runs in your browser. It displays data derived from climate models in a
        variety of ways, including maps, graphs and data tables.

        ### Purpose

        PCEX’s purpose is to help you do the following things:

        * Discover what data derived from climate models is available through the
        tool.

        * Select datasets based on the model that produced the data, the
        emissions scenario that drove the model, and the variable of interest.

        * Visualize a selected dataset in a variety of ways, including:

          * geospatially (on an interactive map)

          * as one or more graphs, typically presenting change over time

          * as a statistical summary table

        * Download the data shown in a visualization as an Excel compatible
        table or a CSV file.

        ### Application elements

        It helps to have a little terminology for the various parts of the
        PCEX user interface.

        ## Data available in PCEX

        There are four types of data available in PCEX.
        (Click on a heading to expand the full explanation of each type.)

        ### Model output

        Daily temperature and precipitation data output
        by global or regional climate models based on a
        combination of historical data and possible future greenhouse
        gas projections. The data is averaged by month over thirty year
        periods; there are six such periods from 1960 to 2100.
        This data is available for all of Canada.

        * **`pr`**

          Precipitation at ground level

        * **`tasmax`**

          Daily maximum near-surface air temperature

        * **`tasmin`**

          Daily minimum near-surface air temperature

        * **`prsn`**

          Precipitation at ground level while mean daily temperature is below freezing
        
        ### Climdex (climate extremes indices)

        Measures of weather extremes calculated from model output.
        Climdex defines 27 [climate extremes indices](${$$.components.climdexUrl}),
        encompassing extreme precipitation, extremes of temperature,
        or lack thereof in different ways.
        This is a heterogeneous dataset; a given extreme may be calculated
        either as a monthly index averaged over thirty year periods
        from 1960 to 2100, or an annual index calculated individually
        for each year from 1950 to 2100.
        This data is available for all of Canada.

        ### Degree-day variables

        Calculated from model output, a degree-day variable
        counts how many days fall below or above a given temperature
        threshold multiplied by how many degrees the threshold is exceeded,
        over a period of a season or year.
        The data is averaged over six thirty year periods between
        1960 to 2100, namely
        1961-1990,
        1971-2000,
        1981-2010,
        2010-2039,
        2040-2069, and
        2070-2099.
        This data is available for all of British Columbia.

        A degree-day is a measure of how much
        the actual temperature (usually the mean average temperature)
        falls either above or below a threshold temperature that
        represents a temperature of
        interest (e.g., freezing, temperature at which cooling is
        required).
        For a given degree-day measure,
        the difference is only counted when the actual
        temperature is either above or below the threshold,
        the condition (above, below) being given as part of the
        measure's definition.
        One degree day is one day with a temperature
        difference from threshold of 1 degree (in Canada, &deg;C).
        A day with a temperature difference of 3 degrees represents
        3 degree-days. The total degree-days over a given period
        (e.g., a month, a year) is the total degree-days for each day
        in that period, always respecting both the threshold and the
        condition (above, below) in counting each day. This means that
        when both seasonal and annual degree day data are viewed in a
        chart or table, the annual values will be larger, as they 
        represent the sum of the seasonal values.

        * **`cdd`**

          Cooling Degree Days: Degree-days during the specified time 
          period above 18&deg;C.

        * **`hdd`**
        
          Heating Degree Days: Degree-days during the specified time 
          period below 18&deg;C.

        * **`gdd`**
        
          Growing Degree Days: Degree-days during the specified time 
          period above 5&deg;C.

        * **`fdd`**
        
          Frost Degree Days: Degree-days during the specified time 
          period below 0&deg;C.
        
        ### Return period variables

        A return period variable describes extreme temperature or
        precipitation events that would be expected to occur once
        during a specified "return period," for example once every
        20 years.
        These datasets are calculated from model output using a
        generalized extreme value distribution.
        This data is available for four thirty year climatological
        periods from 1970 to 2100, namely
        1971-2000,
        2011-2040,
        2041-2070, and
        2071-2100.
        This data is available for all of British Columbia.

        ## Datasets and data filtering

        PCEX has a huge base of data available—far too much
          to present usefully in any single view. A selection (filtering)
          process must come between data and presentation.

        ### Datasets

        A _dataset_ is a collection of data for a specific model,
          emissions scenario, variable, model run, and time period. It
          comprises values of the variable for specific points in space and
          time, usually over a regular spatial grid and sequence of time
          points.
        

        Specifically, a dataset is a collection of geospatial
          (longitude-latitude) grids. Each geospatial grid holds the data for
          a particular
          time. (Conversely, you could think of a dataset as a geospatial grid
          of time series, but the data is in fact stored as a grid per time
          value.)

        ### Dataset filtering

        The first step of any effort to examine the available data is
        to select a smaller, more digestible subset of it to be examined.
        This selection goes by the name of _dataset filtering_ or
        just _filtering_.
        

        The criteria by which datasets are filtered  are:

        * **Model**

          Which GCM produced the base data for the dataset.
          (Almost all data available in PCEX is further
          processed
          from this base data. Specifically, most of the data available
          has
          been downscaled from the relatively coarse global grid of the
          GCM to
          a finer grid suited to regional analysis. Other post-processing
          includes forming long-term averages and forming derived
          variables
          such as climate indices.)

        * **Emissions Scenario**

          Which scenario of climate-changing emissions (greenhouse gases,
          etc.) was used as an input to the model runs.

        * **Variable(s)**

          Which output variable(s) from the model runs
          you are interested in. (For example: maximum temperature,
          precipitation, number of frost-free days.)
          
        The result of data filtering is a collection of one or
          more _datasets_.
        

        #### Distinguishing datasets within a filtered collection

        Filtering (by model, emissions scenario, variable) in general
        results in more than one dataset.
        
        Individual datasets within a filtered collection are characterized by:

        * **Model Run**

          The following explanation is taken
          from [ENES](https://portal.enes.org/data/enes-model-data/cmip5/datastructure):

          > Many CMIP5 experiments, the so-called ensemble calculations,
            were calculated using several initial states, initialisation
            methods or physics details. Ensemble calculations facilitate
            quantifying the variability of simulation data concerning a
            single model. For example, climate model simulations are
            dependent on the initial state. The variability we know from
            weather is also existent in climate simulations. The ensemble
            members with different initial states are usually called
            realizations. Initialisation method and physics details may also
            have an influence. Physics details may be parameterisation
            constants, for example. In the CMIP5 project, ensemble members
            are named in the rip-nomenclature, r for realization, i for
            initialisation and p for physics, followed by an integer, e.g.
            r1i1p1.

          You will find all datasets in CE labelled by a rip code as above.

        * **Time Period**

          The time period the dataset spans.

      - |
        ## Data presentations

        PCEX presents data in several different ways. The
        following is a summary of the different presentations available.

        * **Data Map**

          The Data Map is an interactive web map that presents one or two
          datasets selected from the filtered collection. It shows a
          spatial slice of the data for a specific point in time.

          A single variable (or the primary variable in a comparison view)
          is represented as a raster (a grid of coloured blocks)
          overlaid on the base map.
          Colours encode the variable’s value.

          The secondary variable (in a comparison view) is represented as
          a set of isolines (contours of constant value) overlaid on the
          base map. Isolines are colour-coded by value.

          The data map is the most complex data presentation tool, and
            has a
            substantial collection of generic web mapping features and data
            presentation features. See below for details of these
            features.


        * **Data Graphs**

          A data graph typically presents a non-spatial view of one or
          more datasets. Typically this view is temporal, that is, it is a
          graph with time as the horizontal axis.

          Depending on the specific graph, more than one dataset may be
          represented. This is useful for comparing datasets and/or giving
          context to the dataset(s) displayed in the data map.

          IMPORTANT: Spatial averaging: Data shown in all graphs is averaged
          over either the entire spatial extent of the dataset or over the
          spatial extent you select by drawing a polygon on the map.


        * **Statistical Summary**

          The Statistical Summary table presents a statistical summary of
          a single dataset. The summary includes the usual statistics such
          as mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, etc.

          IMPORTANT: Spatial averaging: Data summarized in this table is
          averaged over either the entire spatial extent of the dataset or
          over the spatial extent you select by drawing a polygon on the
          map.

        ## Data Map features

        ### Map tools

        On the left-hand side of the map you will find a standard
        selection of web map tools.

        **Note on terminology**: “Layer”: Technically a
        polygon is a “map layer.” You only need to know this because it
        is the terminology used in the the tooltips for the various
        polygon-drawing tools. Read “layer” as “polygon.”

        #### Zoom In / Zoom Out

        To zoom in or out on the map:

        1. Click the **+** (zoom in) or **-** (zoom out) button on the map
        toolbar.

        1. Alternatively, roll the mouse wheel forward (zoom in) or backward
        (zoom out) with the mouse cursor over the map.

        1. Alternatively, on a touch screen, spread (zoom in) or pinch
        (zoom out) on the map.

        #### Draw Polygon

        To draw a general polygon on the map:

        1. Click the **Draw Polygon** button on the map toolbar.

        1. Click on the first point placed to complete the polygon.

        #### Draw Rectangle

        To draw a rectangular area on the map. (It is a rectangle in pixel
          coordinates, not in projection coordinates.)

        1. Click the **Draw Rectangle** button on the map toolbar.

        1. On the map, click on one corner of the desired rectangle,
        drag to the opposite corner and release.

        #### Edit Polygon

        To edit an existing polygon on the map:

        1. Click the **Edit Polygon** button on the map toolbar.

        1. The mouse cursor becomes a pointer.
        **Save** and **Cancel** buttons appear next to the **Edit Polygon** button.

        1. Editing handles (square boxes) appear at each polygon vertex and
        at the midpoint of each polygon side. Vertex handles are opaque white;
        midpoint handles are semitransparent white.

        1. To move a vertex, click on its handle and drag.
        Release at the desired new position.

        1. To create a new vertex, click on a midpoint handle and drag.
        Release at the desired new position.

        1. When you have made all desired changes to the polygon, click
        the **Save** button next to the **Edit Polygon** button.
        To discard all changes, click the **Cancel** button.

        1. The modified polygon is saved and the editing handles disappear.

        #### Delete Polygons (Layers)

        To delete a single polygon:

        All polygons are immediately deleted without confirmation.

        #### Import Polygon

        Imports a polygon defined in an external file. Accepts a zipped
          Shapefile or a GeoJSON file containing a single Feature (not a
          FeatureCollection).

        To import a polygon:

        1. Click the **Import Polygon** button on the map toolbar.

        1. Click **Choose File**.

        1. Navigate to and select the file containing the polygon definition.

        1. Click **OK**.

        1. The imported polygon is added to your map.

        #### Export Polygon

        Exports a polygon in one of the following formats: Shapefile,
          GeoJSON, WKT, KML, GPX.

        To export a polygon:
        
        1. Click the **Export Polygon** button.

        1. Click a button for the desired export file format.
        
        1. Navigate to the desired location to save the file and enter
          a name for the file.

        1. Click **Save**.
        
        1. The polygon on your map is saved to the file in the
          selected format.

        ### Colour scales and autoscaling

        On the right-hand side of the map, you will find one or two colour
        scale references and the autoscale (AS) button.

        #### Colour scales

        A _colour scale_ is a mapping between values that points in
        the dataset can take on and the colour displayed on the map to
        represent that data point.

        Mappings from data value to colour essentially treat colour as
        one-dimensional real variable ranging from 0 (first colour) to 1
        (last colour). For the purposes of discussion, we call this colour
        variable the “colour index.”

        In general, a colour scale maps data values lying between chosen
        minimum and maximum values, V<sub>min</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>,
        respectively. Those values are usually determined by the value range
        of the dataset. Sometimes they are actually the dataset minimum and
        maximum values; sometimes they are derived from other, comparison
        datasets. To convey the maximum amount of information to the human
        user, the minimum and maximum values should be close to the dataset’s
        minimum and maximum values.

        We offer two different types of colour scale, linear and
        logarithmic. These are distinguished by how data values are mapped
        onto the colour index:

        * Linear: Maps the value of the data point linearly to colour
          index, with V<sub>min</sub> mapping to colour index 0, and
          V<sub>max</sub>
          mapping to colour index 1.

        * Logarithmic: Maps the logarithm of the data point linearly
          to colour index, with log(V<sub>min</sub>) mapping to colour
          index 0, and log(V<sub>max</sub>) mapping to colour index 1.

        #### Colour scale references

        A _colour scale reference_ is a map tool that shows
        the relationship between a colour displayed on the map and the value
        of the data (variable) represented by that colour. Three
        representative data values are shown to the left of the colour band:
        
        * Top: V<sub>max</sub>

        * Middle: Mean value.

            * If linear colour scale, arithmetic mean = 
            (V<sub>min</sub> + V<sub>max</sub>)/2.

            * If logarithmic colour scale, geometric mean =
            sqrt(V<sub>min</sub> * V<sub>max</sub>).

        * Bottom: V<sub>min</sub>

        When only one variable is displayed on the map (as a raster),
        there is one colour scale reference.

        When two colour-mapped variables are displayed on the map (raster and
        isolines), there are two colour scale references. The upper reference
        is for isolines and the lower reference is for raster.

        #### Autoscaling

        _Autoscaling_ readjusts the colour scale to span only the range of
        data values that are currently visible on the map.

        For example, suppose
        the entire map shows a range of values between 0 and 100. Then you
        zoom in on a small area where the range of data values lies between,
        say, 20 and 30. The colour scale for the 0 to 100 range will not show
        much distinction, if any, between values between 20 and 30. Click the
        autoscale (**AS**) button, and the colour scale is readjusted so that
        its minimum value is 20 and maximum value is 30.

        To reset the colour scale to the full data range, zoom out so that
        all data is in view on the map, then click **AS**.

        ## Exported data file formats</h2>

        ### File formats: XSLX and CSV
        
        Both file formats convey information as table with rows and
        columns, as typically managed by spreadsheet programs.

        * **XSLX**
        
          This format is compatible with Microsoft Excel.
        
        * **CSV**
        
          This format is plain text in the comma-separated variables format,
          with column separator being the comma (`,`).

        ### Content formats

        Each graph or data table is exported in a table layout suitable
        to its content. The following sections detail each such layout.

      - header: Description
        body: |
          A tool for visualizing and downloading climate model outputs and data derived from those outputs.

          The PCIC Climate Explorer (PCEX) is also fondly known as 'the marmot,' since it is an improvement
          (we sincerely hope) on its predecessor, the Regional Analysis Tool, or 'RAT.' Hence our mascot in the header.
