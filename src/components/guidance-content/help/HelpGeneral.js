          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <h3>What it is</h3>
          <p>Climate Explorer is an interactive web application that runs in
            your browser. It displays data derived from climate models in a
            variety of ways, including maps, graphs and data tables.</p>
          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>Climate Explorer’s purpose is to help you do the following
            things:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Discover what data derived from climate models is available
                through the tool.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Select datasets based on the model that produced the data,
                the emissions scenario that drove the model, and the variable of
                interest.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Visualize a selected dataset in a variety of ways,
                including:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>geospatially (on an interactive map)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>as one or more graphs, typically presenting change over
                    time</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>as a statistical summary table</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Download the data shown in a visualization as an Excel
                compatible table or a CSV file.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Application elements</h3>
          <p>It helps to have a little terminology for the various parts of the
            Climate Explorer application.</p>

          <h2>Datasets and data filtering</h2>
          <p>Climate Explorer has a huge base of data available—far too much
            to present usefully in any single view. A selection (filtering)
            process must come between data and presentation.</p>
          <h3>Datasets</h3>
          <p>A <i>dataset</i> is a collection of data for a specific model,
            emissions scenario, and variable, model run, and time period. It
            comprises values of the variable for specific points in space and
            time, usually over a regular spatial grid and sequence of time
            points.
          </p>
          <p>Specifically, a dataset is a collection of geospatial
            (longitude-latitude) grids. Each grid holds the data for a particular
            time. (Conversely, you could think of a dataset as a geospatial grid
            of time series, but the data is in fact stored as a grid per time
            value.)</p>
          <h3>Dataset filtering</h3>
          <p>The first step of any effort to examine all the available data is
            to select a smaller, more digestible subset of it to be examined.
            This selection goes by the name of <i>dataset filtering</i> or just
            <i>filtering</i>.
          </p>
          <p>The criteria by which datasets are filtered  are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Model: Which GCM produced the base data for the dataset.
                (Almost all data available in Climate Explorer is further
                processed
                from this base data. Specifically, most of the data available
                has
                been downscaled from the relatively coarse global grid of the
                GCM to
                a finer grid suited to regional analysis. Other post-processing
                includes forming long-term averages and forming derived
                variables
                such as climate indices.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Emissions Scenario: Which scenario of climate-changing
                emissions (greenhouse gases, etc.) was used as an input to the
                model
                runs.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Variable(s): Which output variable(s) from the model runs
                you are interested in. (For example: maximum temperature,
                precipitation, number of frost-free days.)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The result of data filtering is a collection of one or more
            <i>datasets</i>.
          </p>
          <h4>Distinguishing datasets within a filtered
            collection</h4>
          <p>Filtering (by model, emissions scenario, variable) in general
            results in more than one dataset.
          </p>
          <p>Individual datasets within a filtered collection are characterized
            by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Model Run: explain</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Time Period: The time the dataset spans.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Data presentations</h2>
          <p>Climate Explorer presents data in several different ways. The
            following is a summary of the different presentations available.</p>
          <h3>Data Map</h3>
          <p>The Data Map is an interactive web map that presents one or two
            datasets selected from the filtered collection. It shows a spatial
            slice of the data for a specific point in time.</p>
          <p>A single variable (or the primary variable in a comparison view)
            is represented as a grid of coloured blocks overlaid on the base map.
            Colours encode the variable’s value.</p>
          <p>The secondary variable (in a comparison view) is represented as a
            set of isolines (contours of constant value) overlaid on the base
            map. Isolines are colour-coded by value.</p>
          <p>The data map is the most complex data presentation tool, and has a
            substantial collection of generic web mapping features and data
            presentation features. See below for details of these features.</p>
          <h3>Data Graphs</h3>
          <p>A data graph typically presents a non-spatial view of one or more
            datasets. Typically this view is temporal, that is, it is a graph
            with time as the horizontal axis.</p>
          <p>Depending on the specific graph, more than one dataset may be
            represented. This is useful for comparing  datasets and/or giving
            context to the dataset(s) displayed in the data map.</p>
          <p>IMPORTANT: Spatial averaging: Data shown in all graphs is averaged
            over either the entire spatial extent of the dataset or over the
            spatial extent you select by drawing a polygon on the map.</p>
          <h3>Statistical Summary</h3>
          <p>The Statistical Summary table presents a statistical summary of a
            single dataset. The summary includes the usual statistics such as
            mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, etc.</p>
          <p>IMPORTANT: Spatial averaging: Data summarized in this table is
            averaged over either the entire spatial extent of the dataset or over
            the spatial extent you select by drawing a polygon on the map.</p>
          <h2>Data Map features</h2>
          <h3>Map tools</h3>
          <p>On the left-hand side of the map you will find a standard
            selection of web map tools.</p>
          <p><b>Note </b><b>on terminology</b>: “Layer”: Technically a
            polygon is a “map layer.” You only need to know this because it
            is the terminology used in the the tooltips for the various
            polygon-drawing tools. Read “layer” as “polygon.”</p>
          <h4>Zoom In / Zoom Out</h4>

                selected format.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Colour scales and autoscaling</h3>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the map, you will find one or two colour
            scale references and the autoscale (AS) button.</p>
          <h4>Colour scales</h4>
          <p>A <i>colour scale</i> is a mapping between values that points in
            the dataset can take on and the colour displayed on the map to
            represent that data point.</p>
          <p>Mappings from data value to colour essentially treat colour as
            one-dimensional real variable ranging from 0 (first colour) to 1
            (last colour). For the purposes of discussion, we call this colour
            variable the “colour index.”</p>
          <p>In general, a colour scale maps data values lying between chosen
            minimum and maximum values, V<sub>min</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>,
            respectively. Those values are usually determined by the value range
            of the dataset. Sometimes they are actually the dataset minimum and
            maximum values; sometimes they are derived from other, comparison
            datasets. To convey the maximum amount of information to the human
            user, the minimum and maximum values should be close to the dataset’s
            minimum and maximum values.</p>
          <p>We offer two different types of color scale, linear and
            logarithmic. These are distinguished by how data values are mapped
            onto the colour index:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Linear: Maps the value of the data point linearly to colour
                index, with V<sub>min</sub> mapping to colour index 0, and
                V<sub>max</sub>
                mapping to colour index 1.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Logarithmic: Maps the logarithm of the data point linearly
                to colour index, with log(V<sub>min</sub>) mapping to colour
                index
                0, and log(V<sub>max</sub>) mapping to colour index 1.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Colour scale references</h4>
          <p>A <i>colour scale </i><i>reference</i> is a map tool that shows
            the relationship between a colour displayed on the map and the value
            of the data (variable) represented by that colour. Three
            representative data values are shown to the left of the colour band:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Top: V<sub>max</sub></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Middle: Mean value.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>If linear colour scale, arithmetic mean = (V<sub>min</sub>
                    + V<sub>max</sub>)/2.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>If logarithmic colour scale, geometric mean =
                    sqrt(V<sub>min</sub>
                    * V<sub>max</sub>).</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                <p>Bottom: V<sub>min</sub></p>
              </li>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>When only one variable is displayed on the map (as coloured
            blocks), there is one colour scale reference.</p>
          <p>When two variables are displayed on the map (coloured blocks and
            isolines), there are two colour scale references. The upper reference
            is for isolines and the lower reference is for colour blocks.</p>
