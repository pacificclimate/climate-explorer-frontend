/*********************************************************************
 * DualDataController.js - controller component for numerical display
 * of two variables at once, supporting comparison between them.
 *
 * Receives a model, experiment, and two variables from its parent,
 * [Dual|Precip]AppController. Provides widgets for users to select a specific
 * slice of the data (timespan or run). Queries the API to fetch data on
 * both variables for the DataGraph viewers it manages, Annual Cycle Graph,
 * Long Term Average Graph, and Timeseries Graph, to show comparisons of
 * the two variables.
 *
 * If a user selects two variables that come from multi year mean datasets,
 * an Annual Graph and a Long Term Average Graph will be displayed. If a
 * user selects two variables that are not multi year means, the less
 * structured Timeseries Graph will be displayed.
 *
 * In either case, a Variable Response scatterplot is displayed, with the
 * secondary variable along the x axis (explanatory variable) and the
 * primary variable along the y axis (response variable).
 *
 * Selecting one multi year mean dataset and one nominal time dataset
 * displays an error message, as comparing these is not as simple as
 * plotting them on the same graph.
 *
 * The main variable is internally referred to as "variable" the
 * variable being compared to it is the "comparand." Available data
 * is based on the main variable; it's possible to display a dataset with
 * the main variable when the comparand is lacking matching data,
 * but not vice versa.
 *
 * Also allows downloading of the data displayed in the graphs.
 *
 * Children: DualAnnualCycleGraph, DualLongTermAveragesGraph
 *           DualVariableResponseGraph, DualTimeSeriesGraph
