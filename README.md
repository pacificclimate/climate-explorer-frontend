[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/pacificclimate/climate-explorer-frontend/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/pacificclimate/climate-explorer-frontend)

Front end interface for the PCIC Climate Explorer. Node, React.js, Webpack, Babel, ES6+.

## Requirements

Node.js = 22.x.x (**important**)

All other package requirements are specified in `package.json`. And their specific versions in the package-lock.json.

We **strongly** recommend using [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage your `node`/`npm` install.
In particular, you will have trouble finding later versions of Node.js in standard Linux installs;
`nvm` however is up to date with all recent releases.

Devcontainer files are provided in .devcontainer to facilitate these requirements using that development environment.

Note: Avoid `snap` packages. Experience to date suggests it does not result in stable, reliable installations.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

Main configuration of the Climate Explorer frontend is done via environment variables.

In a Create React App app, [environment variables are managed carefully](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).
Therefore, most of the environment variables below begin with `REACT_APP_`, as required by CRA.

CRA also provides a convenient system for setting default values of environment variables
in various contexts (development, production, etc.).

Brief summary:

- `.env`: Global default settings
- `.env.development`: Development-specific settings (`npm start`)
- `.env.production`: Production-specific settings (`npm run build`)

For more details, see the
[CRA documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)).

Environment variables for configuring the app are:

`PUBLIC_URL`

- Base **URL** for CE frontend app.
- For production, set this to the URL for CE configured in our proxy server.
- **WARNING**: The path component of this value **MUST** match `REACT_APP_CE_BASE_PATH` (see below).

`REACT_APP_CE_BASE_PATH`

- Base **path** of the URL for the CE frontend app;
- For production, set this to the path component of the URL for CE configured in our proxy server.
- **WARNING**: This **MUST** match the path component of `PUBLIC_URL` (see above).

`REACT_APP_CE_CURRENT_VERSION`

- Current version of the app.
- This value should be set using `generate-commitish.sh` when the Docker image is built (see below).
- It is not recommended to manually override the automatically generated value when the image is run.
- No default value for this variable is provided in any `.env` file.

`REACT_APP_CE_BACKEND_URL`

- Publicly accessible URL for backend climate data.

`REACT_APP_TILECACHE_URL`

- Tilecache URL for basemap layers.

`REACT_APP_NCWMS_URL`

- ncWMS URL for climate layers.

`REACT_APP_CE_ENSEMBLE_NAME`

- Ensemble name to use for backend requests.

`REACT_APP_MAP_LAYER_ID_TYPE`

- Type of identifier used by the app in requests for map climate layers.
  - Value `dynamic` selects the dynamic dataset identifier type.
    A dynamic dataset identifier is formed by prefixing the value of
    `REACT_APP_MAP_LAYER_ID_PREFIX` to the filepath of the dataset
    (obtained from the metadata).
  - Any other values selects static (preconfigured) dataset identifier type.
    A simple dataset identifier is the unqiue_id of the dataset
    (obtained from the metadata).

`REACT_APP_MAP_LAYER_ID_PREFIX`

- Prefix used to form a dynamic dataset identifier, if requested.
  (See item above.)

`REACT_APP_VARIABLE_OPTIONS`

- Path within the `public` folder of the variable options file.

`REACT_APP_EXTERNAL_TEXT`

- Path within the `public` folder of the external text file.

`NODE_ENV`

- [**Automatically set; cannot be overridden manually.**](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables)

### Variable options

A certain amount of configuration of the app is accomplished through the variable options file,
which is a YAML file stored at a location specified by the environment variable `REACT_APP_VARIABLE_OPTIONS`.
The source for the default version of this file is at `./public/variable-options.yaml`.

For documentation on the contents of this file, see the comments at the head
of the file.

See Production section below for information on "live updating" this file.

## Development

This project is now based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Originally it was a manually managed Webpack/Babel project,
but, for a variety of reasons you can read about in [issue 297](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climate-explorer-frontend/issues/297),
we "rebased" it on CRA.

### Installation

You **must** use a version of `npm` >= 5.5.1. This version of `npm` comes with `node` 9.2.0.
If you are using nvm, then run `nvm use 9.2.0` (or higher; ver 11.13 works fine too).

(`npm` 5.5.1 / `node` 9.2.0 is known to work; `npm` 3.5.2 / `node` 8.10.0 is known to fail to install certain required dependencies.
Intermediate versions may or may not work.)

Currently reccomended version is `node` 16.x and `npm` 8.x

With the appropriate versions of `node`/`npm` in use:

```bash
npm install
```

If you need to start fresh after much messing about, the `reinstall` script
deletes `./node_modules/` and then installs:

```bash
npm run reinstall
```

### Running (dev environment)

```bash
npm start
```

For building a production app, see below.

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Linting

Linting is handled by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier can be run directly from the command
line or using the two aliased commands from the [package.json](package.json); `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.
`lint` will check code for errors, format will automatically fix those errors.

Prettier is also installed as a pre-commit hook as per instructions [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html)
using "Option 1. lint-staged".

## Production

### Notes

#### Github Actions

The workflows setup in actions will automatically build, tag and publish to our [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pcic/climate-explorer-frontend).

#### Configuration, environment variables, and Docker

It is best practice to configure a web app externally, at run-time, typically using environment variables for any
simple (atomic, e.g., string) configuration values.

Here we run into a problem introduced by CRA:
CRA injects environment variables only at _build time_, not at run time.
["The environment variables are embedded during the build time. Since Create React App produces a static
HTML/CSS/JS bundle, it canâ€™t possibly read them at runtime."](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables).

We containerize our apps with Docker. A natural approach to deploying apps with Docker is to build the app as
part of the image build, and then just serve it from a container. However, because of CRA's build-time injection
of environment variables, this means that such Docker images cannot be configured at run-time, that is, when
a container is run. Only static, build-time environment variables are available to CRA apps inside such images.

It therefore takes some extra effort to inject run-time environment variables (or configuration generally) into
these Dockerized applications. There are two basic approaches:

1. Build the app, and inject run-time environment variables, as part of the image run (i.e., the command run
   by the image includes building the app, which then has access to environment variables provided via the `docker run`
   command). \* This is simple but it means that containers are slow to start up and contain a lot of infrastructure
   (Node.js, etc.) needed to build the image. This isn't an issue for us, because we don't start many instances and
   we don't do it often.

2. Fetch the environment variables (or a configuration file) from the server.
   - This approach has several variants, which are outlined in this
     [CRA issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2353).
   - The way we load the external text and variable options files falls under into this category.

A key requirement is to be able to configure at run time the the URL at which the app is deployed.
CRA provides a (build-time) environment variable for this, `PUBLIC_URL`.
(Climate Explorer also, as a legacy from pre-CRA versions, uses an overlapping environment variable
`REACT_APP_CE_BASE_PATH`. See Configuration > Environment variables, above.)

Option 2 makes setting `PUBLIC_URL` _much_ harder to accomplish, and would require significant changes to the
codebase.

Option 1 makes setting `PUBLIC_URL` simple and requires almost no change to the codebase;
as noted we don't care about the cost of using such containers.

Therefore we have chosen option 1.

#### Routing and base path

A key requirement is to be able to configure at run time the the URL at which the app is deployed.

Because we are using React Router v4 (react-router-dom), and therefore the HTML5 `pushState` history API via
its [dependency](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history)
[`history`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history),
we [cannot use](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#serving-the-same-build-from-different-paths) t
he relatively simple `package.json` `homepage` property.

Instead we must use CRA-provided build-time environment variable `PUBLIC_URL`.

- It is [discussed briefly](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/using-the-public-folder)
  as the URL for the `public` folder, of which we make use for dynamic configuration assets such as
  external text and variable configuration files.

- `PUBLIC_URL` is also discussed more interestingly in
  [Advanced Configuration](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration):

      > Create React App assumes your application is hosted at the serving web server's root or a subpath as

  specified in package.json (homepage). Normally, Create React App ignores the
  hostname. You may use this variable to force assets to be referenced verbatim
  to the url you provide (hostname included). This may be particularly useful
  when using a CDN to host your application.

`PUBLIC_URL` serves much the same purpose as our custom env variable `REACT_APP_CE_BASE_PATH`.
This redundancy will be eliminated in a future verison of CE.

### Setup using Docker

We use Docker for production deployment.

It can also be useful in development; for example, to test a proposed volume mounting for the container.

#### Build docker image manually

Until recently (roughly, Jan 2019), we were using Dockerhub automated builds
to build our images. Dockerhub recently changed their UI and in doing so broke
all the automated builds. For the moment we need to do manual builds.

Dockerhub images all had the name `pcic/climate-explorer-frontend`.

To distinguish our manually built images, we are omitting the `pcic/` portion
of the name and just using `climate-explorer-frontend`.

Build a docker image:

```bash
docker build -t climate-explorer-frontend \
    --build-arg REACT_APP_CE_CURRENT_VERSION="$(./generate-commitish.sh)" .
```

Setting build arg `REACT_APP_CE_CURRENT_VERSION` as above is the most reliable
way to inject an accurate version into the final app. This value can be overridden
when the image is run, but it is not recommended, as it introduces the possibility
of error.

#### Tag docker image

Dockerhub automatically assigned the tag `latest` to the latest build.
That was convenient, but ...

For manual build procedures,
[tagging with `latest` is not considered a good idea](https://medium.com/@mccode/the-misunderstood-docker-tag-latest-af3babfd6375).
It is better (and easy and immediately obvious) to tag with version/release
numbers. In this example, we will tag with version 1.2.3.

1. Determine the recently built image's ID:

   ```bash
   $ docker images
   REPOSITORY                                                         TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
   climate-explorer-frontend                                          latest              14cb66d3d145        22 seconds ago      867MB

   ```

1. Tag the image:

   ```bash
   Tag the image
   $ docker tag 1040e7f07e5d docker-registry01.pcic.uvic.ca:5000/climate-explorer-frontend:1.2.3
   ```

#### Push docker image to PCIC docker registry

[PCIC maintains its own docker registry](https://pcic.uvic.ca/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3506599). We place manual builds in this registry:

```bash
docker push docker-registry01.pcic.uvic.ca:5000/climate-explorer-frontend:1.2.3
```

#### Run docker image

As described above, environment variables configure the app.
All are given standard development and production values in the files
`.env`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production`.

These can be overridden at run time by providing them in the `docker run` command (`-e` option).

In addition, we mount the configuration files as volumes in the container.
This enables us to update these files without rebuilding or redeploying the app.
See the section below for details.

Typical production run:

```bash
docker run --restart=unless-stopped -d
  -e PUBLIC_URL=<deployment url, including base path>
  -e REACT_APP_CE_BASE_PATH=<deployment base path>
  -e <other env variable>=<value>
  -p <external port>:8080
  --name climate-explorer-frontend
  - v /path/to/external/variable-options.yaml:/app/build/variable-options.yaml
  - v /path/to/external/external-texts/default.yaml:/app/build/external-texts/default.yaml
  climate-explorer-frontend:<tag>
```

## Updating configuration files

Certain parts of Climate Explorer are configured in external configuration files.
These configuration files are stored in [the `public` folder](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/using-the-public-folder).
The path to each configuration file inside this folder specified by an environment variable.
Specifically:

| Configuration    | Env variable                 | Default value              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| External texts   | `REACT_APP_EXTERNAL_TEXT`    | external-text/default.yaml |
| Variable options | `REACT_APP_VARIABLE_OPTIONS` | variable-options.yaml      |

During a build (`npm run build`),
files in the `public` folder are copied directly, without bundling, to the build directory (normally, `./build`).
Files in the `build` folder can be updated on the fly, so that changes to them can be made without creating
a new release of Climate Explorer.

When running the app in a production environment, we mount an external configuration file as a volume
in the docker container. (See section above.)
This external file can be modified, and the container restarted, to provide an updated version of the
variable options file without needing to modify source code, create a new release, or rebuild the image.

To change the configuration file without creating a new release of the app:

- Update the configuration file in the external file system.
- Restart the container (`docker restart climate-explorer-frontend`)

Alternatives:

- Stop the app and start it again with a different value for the associated environment variable,
  and a corresponding volume mount for this new file.

To prevent tears, hair loss, and the cursing of your name by future developers (including yourself),
we **strongly recommend also updating** the source configuration files in the repo (in the `public` folder)
with any changes made, so that they are in fact propagated to later versions. "Hot updates" should not be stored
outside of the version control system.

## Releasing

Creating a versioned release involves:

1. Increment `version` in `package.json`
2. Summarize the changes from the last version in `NEWS.md`
3. Commit these changes, then tag the release:

```bash
git add package.json NEWS.md
git commit -m"Bump to version x.x.x"
git tag -a -m"x.x.x" x.x.x
git push --follow-tags
```

## Code style standard compliance

We have nominally
[adopted](https://github.com/pacificclimate/climate-explorer-frontend/issues/138)
the default ESLint code style.
We aren't enforcing it right now, unfortunately.

Enforcement aside, we continue to commit code that is in violation of these
standards, which is undesirable for at least two reasons:

- Following a coding standard makes the code _much_ easier to read.
- For those of us with an IDE plugin that flags standards violations,
  they appear _all over the place_, which is distracting to say the least.

The coding standard we adopted has a lot of rules, but the following are the
ones we are violating most. A small effort could radically reduce the number
of new violations we introduce. In approximate order of frequency of violation:

1. Limit line length to 80 characters.
1. Use single quotes for strings. (Double quotes are visually noisier.)
1. Place a space after a begin comment delimiter. (`// comment...`, not `//comment...`.)
1. Place a space between `if` and `for` and the opening parenthesis. (`if (cond)`, not `if(cond)`)
1. Declare variables with `const` or `let`, in that order of preference; avoid `var`. (`const` and `let` are scoped.)
   - Use `for (const prop in obj)` and `for (const val of iterable)`, but `for (let i = 1; i < n; i++)`
